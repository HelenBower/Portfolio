        <p>I was born in the United States, in a hospital that has long since been demolished. I was homeschooled for six years by my mother. When I went into sixth grade I was put into Seven Oaks Classical school. I was in Seven Oaks for the next five years. During those five years I had many freelance jobs. I also joined volleyball (as a player and the team manager), track and field, chess club, environmental science club, won the perseverance award and first place in the middle school declamation contest. I was also on the student activities council, and participated in the writing club. </p>
        <p>I still dog sit and assist my older brother with his lawn care company, as well as volunteer at many places, including, but not limited to, New Beginnings Pregnancy Resource Center, and the Wonderlab. I have also done many different manual labor jobs. Near the end of my sophomore year of highschool I got a quite questionable email about a free coding camp. I showed it to my parents and every one of us thought it was a scam. Eventually I was overcome with curiosity, so I emailed back with questions. Turns out it was real, and it was worth the interviews and effort to get in...

   <p>I am currently a Nextech catapult entering my third year of high school. Because of the catapult program I now know HTML, JavaScript, and CSS. Before I started at Nextech I had no coding experience whatsoever, and now I very much enjoy the activity. Although I do not know where I will be going to school in the fall, I do know that I will be trying to take a computer science class to learn more about coding and computers in general. As of now I intern at Nextech and mow lawns when my brother has a job for me. I am also still volunteering and dog sitting when I have the time.

      <div class="epilogueText">
        <p>I want to become an author, UX designer, traveler, missionary, or graphic designer when I graduate highschool (or finish a book). My dream college is Pensacola Christian College (PCC), but I am also looking at The Crown College and a few others. For pets I would like to get a black GSD, a red Alaskan Malamute, and a gray Siberian cat. When I get enough money, I either want to move into a medieval castle in Scotland, or a snug cottage in northern Maine. Either way though, I'd like to have at a ton of land to explore.</p>
